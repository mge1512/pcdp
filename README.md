# Piccadilly — PCDP — Post-Coding Development Paradigm

**Human Intent, Machine Implementation.**

*Meet me at the Piccadilly — the place where intent becomes implementation.* 

PCDP is an open specification for a new software development paradigm: domain experts write structured natural-language specifications; AI generates all implementation code. Engineers never write implementation code directly.

This is not "AI-assisted coding" where developers write code with AI suggestions. This is **post-coding development** where specifications are the primary artifact and code is a generated output.

**The key distinction:** if the generated code is wrong, you never edit the code — you fix the specification and regenerate. The spec is always the source of truth.

`pcdp-lint`, the reference validator in this repository, was itself specified and generated using PCDP — with zero hand-written implementation code.

## Target Language Resolution

The target language is **never declared in the specification**. It is derived automatically from the deployment template.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    spec["Deployment: cli-tool"]
    presets["/usr/share/pcdp/ → /etc/pcdp/
~/.config/pcdp/ → ./.pcdp/"]
    resolved["Language: Go
RPM · DEB · OCI via OBS"]

    spec --> presets --> resolved

    style spec fill:#e1f5ff,stroke:#4a9eff
    style presets fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#4caf50
    style resolved fill:#fce4ec,stroke:#e91e63
```

## Key Concepts

**Deployment templates** define what a target environment requires — language defaults, binary type, packaging formats, installation method, conventions. The spec author declares `Deployment: cli-tool`, `Deployment: backend-service`, or another template, and the template resolves implementation details automatically.

**Verification paths** are optional and pluggable:
- *Direct path:* Specification → Go/C/Rust — fast iteration, lower assurance
- *Verified path:* Specification → Lean 4/F*/Dafny → Go/C — formal proofs, highest assurance

**Audit bundles** are first-class outputs: specification + generated code + proofs (if any) + translation report + metadata. Designed for regulatory compliance with ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304, and Common Criteria.

## Quick Start

### Step 1 — Write a specification

**Option A — AI-assisted interview *(recommended)***

Domain experts do not need to learn the specification format. Use
`prompts/interview-prompt.md` with any capable LLM — including small models
running locally without GPU acceleration.

- **No existing material:** the model interviews the expert one question at a time
- **Existing material** (email, meeting notes, design doc): paste it in — the model extracts what it can and asks only for what is missing

```bash
# with a local model:
ollama run llama3.2 "$(cat prompts/interview-prompt.md)"
```

**Option B — Write the spec directly**

Every specification follows this structure:

```markdown
# My Component

## META
Deployment:   cli-tool
Version:      0.1.0
Spec-Schema:  0.3.15
Author:       Your Name <you@example.org>
License:      Apache-2.0
Verification: none
Safety-Level: QM

## TYPES
...

## BEHAVIOR: my-operation
Constraint: required
INPUTS: ...
PRECONDITIONS: ...
STEPS:
  1. [action]; on failure → [error].
  2. [next action].
POSTCONDITIONS: ...
ERRORS: ...

## INVARIANTS
- [observable]      ...
- [implementation]  ...

## EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE: success_case
GIVEN: ...
WHEN:  ...
THEN:  ...

EXAMPLE: error_case
GIVEN: ...
WHEN:  ...
THEN:  result = Err(...)
```

Validate with `pcdp-lint myspec.md` before proceeding.

---

### Step 2 — Translate to code

Use the standard translator prompt from `prompts/prompt.md` with any capable LLM. The prompt instructs the LLM to:

- Derive the target language from the deployment template — never declared in the spec
- Produce all required deliverables from the template's DELIVERABLES section
- Write a `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` documenting every decision and confidence level

---

## Tooling

### pcdp-lint

`pcdp-lint` — the validator in `tools/pcdp-lint/` — was specified and generated using PCDP itself. The specification in `tools/pcdp-lint/spec/pcdp-lint.md` describes what the tool must do. The implementation in `tools/pcdp-lint/code/` was generated from that specification by an LLM, using `cli-tool.template.md` as the deployment template.

The LLM resolved Go as the target language from the template without being told. It produced the source code, RPM spec, Debian packaging, and a `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` — all from the specification alone.

### mcp-server-pcdp

`mcp-server-pcdp` is an MCP server that makes the full PCDP toolchain accessible to any MCP-capable LLM host (mcphost, Claude Desktop, VS Code, KIT, custom agents) — no local file copies of templates or prompts needed.

**Tools** (callable by the LLM):

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `list_templates` | List all installed deployment templates |
| `get_template` | Retrieve a template by name |
| `list_resources` | List all available resources (templates, prompts, hints) |
| `read_resource` | Read any resource by `pcdp://` URI |
| `lint_content` | Validate a spec given as a string — returns structured diagnostics |
| `lint_file` | Validate a spec file on disk |
| `get_schema_version` | Return the Spec-Schema version the server was built against |

**Resources** (browseable by the LLM natively):

| URI pattern | Content |
|---|---|
| `pcdp://templates/{name}` | Full deployment template Markdown |
| `pcdp://prompts/interview` | The interview prompt — guides spec authoring |
| `pcdp://prompts/translator` | The universal translator prompt |
| `pcdp://hints/{template}.{lang}.{lib}` | Library-specific translator hints |

**Usage with mcphost:**

```yaml
mcpServers:
  pcdp:
    command: mcp-server-pcdp
    args: [stdio]
```

A connected LLM can then conduct the full PCDP workflow in a single session:
read the interview prompt → interview the domain expert → write the spec →
call `lint_content` → fix errors → read the template → translate to code.

`mcp-server-pcdp` is itself specified in `tools/mcp-server-pcdp/spec/mcp-server-pcdp.md`
and generated using PCDP. Self-hosting all the way down.

### Empirical results

Both tools were tested across multiple LLMs and model sizes — including small
frontier models via direct API and a 120B open-weight model at a regional EU
provider. Every model resolved Go as the target language from the deployment
template without being told. All implementations passed their compile gates and
test suites without hand-written code.
