# PCDP — Post-Coding Development Paradigm

**Human Intent, Machine Implementation.**

PCDP is an open specification for a new software development paradigm: domain experts write structured natural-language specifications; AI generates all implementation code. Engineers never write implementation code directly.

This is not "AI-assisted coding" where developers write code with AI suggestions. This is **post-coding development** where specifications are the primary artifact and code is a generated output.

`pcdp-lint`, the reference validator in this repository, was itself specified and generated using PCDP — with zero hand-written implementation code.

    end

    subgraph validation[" VALIDATION"]

    end

## Target Language Resolution

The target language is **never declared in the specification**. It is derived automatically from the deployment template — keeping specifications technology-agnostic and stable over time.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    spec["Deployment: cli-tool
    in spec META"]

    subgraph presets[" PRESET LAYERING (systemd-style)"]
        p1["/usr/share/pcdp/templates/
        shipped defaults"]
        p2["/etc/pcdp/
        system administrator"]
        p3["~/.config/pcdp/
        user overrides"]
        p4["./.pcdp/
        project-local"]
        p1 --> p2 --> p3 --> p4
    end

    resolved["Target language: Go
    Binary type: static
    Output: RPM + DEB + OCI
    CLI style: key=value
    Install: OBS"]

    spec --> presets
    presets --> resolved

## Quick Start

### 1. Write a specification

Every specification follows this structure:

```markdown
# My Component

## META
Deployment:  cli-tool
Version:     0.1.0
Spec-Schema: 0.3.7
Author:      Your Name <you@example.org>
License:     Apache-2.0
Verification: none
Safety-Level: QM

## TYPES
...

## BEHAVIOR: my-function
INPUTS: ...
PRECONDITIONS: ...
POSTCONDITIONS: ...

## PRECONDITIONS
...

## POSTCONDITIONS
...

## INVARIANTS
...

## EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE: basic_case
GIVEN:
  ...
WHEN:
  ...
THEN:
  ...
```

### 2. Validate a specification (assuming the tool is already available as a package)

```bash
# Install pcdp-lint (openSUSE / SLES)
zypper install pcdp-lint

# Install pcdp-lint (Debian / Ubuntu)
apt install pcdp-lint

# Install pcdp-lint (Fedora)
dnf install pcdp-lint

# Validate a specification file
pcdp-lint myspec.md

# Strict mode (warnings treated as errors)
pcdp-lint strict=true myspec.md

# List available deployment templates
pcdp-lint list-templates
```

### 3. Translate a specification to code

Use the standard translator prompt from `prompts/prompt.md` with any capable LLM. The prompt instructs the LLM to:

- Derive the target language from the deployment template (never declared in the spec)
- Produce all required deliverables defined in the template's DELIVERABLES section
- Write a `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` documenting decisions and confidence levels

---

## Self-Hosting

`pcdp-lint` — the validator in `tools/pcdp-lint/` — was developed using
PCDP itself. The specification in `tools/pcdp-lint/spec/pcdp-lint.md`
describes what the tool must do. The implementation in
`tools/pcdp-lint/code/` was generated from that specification by an LLM,
using `cli-tool.template.md` as the deployment template.

The LLM resolved Go as the target language from the template without being
told. It produced the source code, RPM spec, Debian packaging, and a
`TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` documenting every decision — all from the
specification alone.

The same approach was tested across multiple LLMs of different capability
classes, including a 120B open-weight model running at a regional European
provider with no dependency on US cloud infrastructure. Every model resolved
the target language correctly from the deployment template.

This is not a toy example. The paradigm specifies and generates its own
tooling from the first real artifact.

---

## Key Concepts

**Deployment templates** define what a target environment requires — language defaults, binary type, packaging formats, installation method, CLI conventions. The spec author declares `Deployment: cli-tool` and the template resolves all implementation details automatically.

**Verification paths** are optional and pluggable:
- *Direct path:* Specification → Go/C/Rust — fast iteration, lower assurance
- *Verified path:* Specification → Lean 4/F*/Dafny → Go/C — formal proofs, highest assurance

**Audit bundles** are first-class outputs: specification + generated code + proofs (if any) + translation report + metadata. Designed for regulatory compliance with ISO 26262, DO-178C, IEC 62304, and Common Criteria.

## Licensing

| Artifact | License |
|---|---|
| Whitepaper, specifications, templates | [CC-BY-4.0](LICENSE) |
| `pcdp-lint` and tools | [GPL-2.0-only](LICENSE-tools) |

The CC-BY-4.0 license on specifications and templates means anyone may implement the paradigm — including proprietary translators and commercial tools — provided attribution is given. The GPL-2.0-only license on `pcdp-lint` ensures the reference validator remains community-controlled and open.

---

## Status

Current version: **0.3.9** (draft)

This project is in active development. The specification format, deployment templates, and tooling are stabilising toward a v1.0 release. Feedback, issue reports, and contributions are welcome.
