## INTERFACES

```
Filesystem {
  // Used by lint_file and set_milestone_status.
  required-methods:
    ReadFile(path)              -> (content: string, error)
    WriteFile(path, content)    -> error
  implementations-required:

    }
}

AssetStore {
  // Provides templates, hints, and prompt content to all MCP tools.
  //
  // ASSET EMBEDDING (build-time):
  //   All assets (templates, hints, prompts) are compiled into the
  //   binary at build time using the language's native asset embedding
  //   mechanism. The binary is self-contained and fully functional
  //   with no pcd-templates package installed at runtime.
  //
  //   The build system stages assets into a location the compiler can
  //   embed from, relative to the store implementation. The exact
  //   mechanism is implementation-defined — see the language hints file.
  //
  //   Staged asset directories are build artefacts only:
  //     - populated by the build system before compilation
  //     - listed in .gitignore
  //     - removed by the clean target
  //     - never committed to the repository
  //     - not required at runtime
  //
  // RUNTIME OVERLAYS (optional, site-local):
  //   After serving embedded assets, the implementation checks
  //   filesystem overlay directories and applies them with last-wins
  //   precedence. All overlay directories are optional — their absence
  //   is not an error.
  //
  //   Overlay search order (ascending precedence):
  //     /usr/share/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     /etc/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     ~/.config/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     ./.pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //
  //   A filesystem entry with the same key as an embedded entry
  //   replaces it. New keys in the filesystem are added alongside
  //   embedded entries.

```

PRECONDITIONS:
- uri matches pattern "pcd://<type>/<n>"

STEPS:
1. Parse uri; if format does not match "pcd://<type>/<n>" →

2. Dispatch by type:
   - "templates": call AssetStore.GetTemplate(n, "latest")
   - "hints":     call AssetStore.GetHints(n)
   - "prompts":   call AssetStore.GetPrompt(n)
   On unknown type → MCP error -32602.
3. On not found → MCP error -32602 with message "resource not found: {uri}".
4. Return ResourceRecord with uri, name, and full content.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- response contains uri, name, and full Markdown content

---

## BEHAVIOR: lint_content
Constraint: required

Validates a PCD specification given as a string. Applies all rules
RULE-01 through RULE-17, identical to the pcd-lint CLI.

INPUTS:
```
content:  string    // full spec Markdown text
filename: string    // used for diagnostics; must have .md extension
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- content is non-empty
- filename has .md extension

STEPS:
1. If filename does not end in ".md" →
   MCP error -32602 with message "filename must have .md extension: {filename}".
2. Run the embedded lint engine on content with filename.
   The lint engine applies RULE-01 through RULE-17 in order.
   All rules run regardless of earlier failures.
3. Return LintResult.

```
path: string    // absolute path to spec file on disk
```

STEPS:
1. Read file via Filesystem.ReadFile(path); on error →
   MCP error -32602 with message "cannot open file: {path}".
2. Extract filename = basename(path).
3. Run lint_content(content, filename).

POSTCONDITIONS:
- Same as lint_content postconditions.

ERRORS:
- MCP error -32602 if file not found or not readable

---

## BEHAVIOR: get_schema_version

---

## BEHAVIOR: set_milestone_status
Constraint: required

Sets the `Status:` field of a named MILESTONE section in a spec file on disk.
Used by the agent pipeline to advance the milestone cursor without human
intervention.

INPUTS:
```
spec_path:        string          // absolute path to the spec .md file
milestone_name:   string          // exact MILESTONE label, e.g. "0.1.0"
new_status:       MilestoneStatus // pending | active | failed | released
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- spec_path exists and is readable and writable
- spec_path has .md extension
- milestone_name matches an existing ## MILESTONE: section in the file
- new_status is a valid MilestoneStatus value

STEPS:
1. Read spec_path from disk via Filesystem.ReadFile; on error →
   MCP error -32602 with message "cannot open file: {spec_path}".
2. Locate the `## MILESTONE: {milestone_name}` section; on not found →
   MCP error -32602 with message
   "MILESTONE '{milestone_name}' not found in {spec_path}".
3. If new_status = "active": scan all other MILESTONE sections in the file.
   If any other section already has `Status: active` →
   MCP error -32602 with message
   "Cannot set MILESTONE '{milestone_name}' to active: MILESTONE '{other}'
    is already active. Set it to released or failed first."
4. Record previous_status (current Status: value, or "pending" if absent).
5. Replace or insert the `Status: {value}` line within the located MILESTONE section.
   MECHANISM: the Status: line must be the first non-blank line after the
   ## MILESTONE: header line. If no Status: line is present, insert one.
   Do not modify any other content in the file.
6. Write the modified content back to spec_path via Filesystem.WriteFile;
   on error → MCP error -32603.
7. Return SetMilestoneResult.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- spec_path on disk has exactly the Status: value changed for the named milestone
- All other content in the file is byte-for-byte identical to the input
- If new_status = "active", no other milestone in the file has Status: active
- result.previous_status reflects the status before this call
- result.new_status = new_status

ERRORS:
- MCP error -32602 if spec_path not found or not readable
- MCP error -32602 if milestone_name not found in spec
- MCP error -32602 if new_status = "active" and another milestone is already active
- MCP error -32603 if write to spec_path fails

---

## BEHAVIOR: assess_change_impact
Constraint: required

Analyses a specification change and recommends the most appropriate
translation strategy: full regeneration from scratch or incremental
update of the existing generated code.

Given the change description and optionally the existing spec and code,
the tool applies the PCD regeneration strategy framework (see whitepaper
A.19) to estimate structural impact, blast radius, scaffold involvement,
and consistency risk.

INPUTS:
```
change_description: string   // unified diff of the spec, or plain-language
                             // description of what changed — required
old_spec:           string   // full spec content before the change — optional
                             // but recommended; improves blast radius analysis
new_spec:           string   // full spec content after the change — optional
existing_code:      string   // generated implementation — optional; if provided,
                             // the tool identifies affected files and functions
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- change_description is non-empty
- At least change_description must be provided; all other inputs are optional

STEPS:
1. Parse change_description to identify which spec sections are affected
   (TYPES, INTERFACES, INVARIANTS, BEHAVIOR, EXAMPLES, MILESTONE, META).
2. If old_spec or new_spec provided: extract the full set of changed elements
   with their section types.
3. Evaluate structural impact:
   a. If TYPES, INTERFACES, or INVARIANTS are affected → structural_impact = "high"
   b. If only BEHAVIOR STEPS or EXAMPLES are affected → structural_impact = "low"
      or "medium" depending on count
   c. If only META is affected → structural_impact = "none"
4. Evaluate scaffold involvement:
   a. If any MILESTONE with Scaffold: true is in the changed scope →
      scaffold_affected = true
   b. Otherwise → scaffold_affected = false
5. Evaluate released milestone involvement:
   a. If any MILESTONE with Status: released is in the changed scope →
      released_milestone_affected = true
   b. Otherwise → released_milestone_affected = false
6. Estimate blast radius:
   a. If existing_code provided: count files and functions referencing changed elements
   b. If not provided: estimate from spec cross-references
   c. Classify: "1–2 BEHAVIORs" | "3–5 BEHAVIORs" | "5+ BEHAVIORs or shared types"
7. Assess consistency risk based on codebase provenance if inferable from inputs.
8. Apply decision rules:
   - If structural_impact = "high" OR scaffold_affected = true OR
     released_milestone_affected = true → recommendation = "full-regeneration"
   - If structural_impact = "low" AND blast_radius ≤ 2 BEHAVIORs AND
     scaffold_affected = false AND released_milestone_affected = false →
     recommendation = "incremental"
   - Otherwise → recommendation = "full-regeneration" (conservative default)
9. Compose reasoning narrative and populate if_incremental or if_regeneration
   fields as appropriate.
10. Return ChangeImpactResult.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- result.recommendation is always set
- result.primary_factor states the single most important deciding factor
- result.reasoning provides a complete narrative suitable for the audit bundle
- if result.recommendation = "incremental": result.if_incremental lists
  the specific files/functions/sections to change
- if result.recommendation = "full-regeneration": result.if_regeneration
  lists decisions from the existing code worth preserving as translator notes

ERRORS:
- MCP error -32602 if change_description is empty

---

## BEHAVIOR: verify_spec_hash
Constraint: required

Computes the SHA256 of a spec file and compares it to the `Spec-SHA256:`
field recorded in the most recent `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` adjacent to the
spec. Reports whether the generated artifacts are current with the spec.

INPUTS:
```
spec_path: string   // path to the spec .md file — required
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- spec_path is non-empty
- spec_path points to a readable file with .md extension

STEPS:
1. Compute SHA256 of the file at spec_path. Store as spec_hash.
2. Look for TRANSLATION_REPORT.md in the same directory as spec_path,
   then in a `code/` subdirectory of the spec's parent directory.
   If not found: return SpecHashResult with status = "no-report".
3. If found: search for a line matching `Spec-SHA256: <hex>` in the report.
   If not found: return SpecHashResult with status = "no-hash-in-report".
4. Extract report_hash from the `Spec-SHA256:` line.
5. If spec_hash = report_hash:
     return SpecHashResult with match = true, status = "current"
   Else:
     return SpecHashResult with match = false, status = "stale"

POSTCONDITIONS:
- result.spec_hash is always the current SHA256 of the spec file
- result.status is one of: "current" | "stale" | "no-report" | "no-hash-in-report"
- result.match is true only when status = "current"

ERRORS:
- MCP error -32602 if spec_path is empty or file not readable
- MCP error -32602 if spec_path does not end in .md

---

## BEHAVIOR: http-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  listen:  ListenAddress    // default: 127.0.0.1:8080

STEPS:
  1. If listen= argument is absent, use 127.0.0.1:8080.
  2. Bind HTTP listener on listen address.
     On bind failure: write error to stderr and exit 1.
  3. Serve MCP Streamable HTTP transport on /mcp endpoint.
  4. On SIGTERM or SIGINT: stop accepting new connections,
     complete in-flight requests, then exit 0.
     MECHANISM: graceful shutdown with 10-second drain timeout.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - All tools and resources are accessible via HTTP POST to /mcp.
  - Server exits 0 on clean shutdown.

ERRORS:
  - exit 1  bind failure

---

## BEHAVIOR: stdio-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  none    // transport is selected by bare-word argument "stdio"

STEPS:
  1. Serve MCP stdio transport: read JSON-RPC from stdin,
     write responses to stdout.
  2. Diagnostics and startup messages to stderr only.
  3. On EOF on stdin or SIGTERM/SIGINT: flush pending writes and exit 0.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - stdout contains only valid MCP JSON-RPC messages.
  - Server exits 0 on clean shutdown.

ERRORS:
  none

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- Invocation provides exactly one transport selector:
    bare word "stdio" → stdio transport
    bare word "http"  → http transport
    (default if neither: stdio)
- If both are given: write error to stderr and exit 2.
- If listen= is given without "http": write warning to stderr, ignore.

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- Server never modifies any file on disk except via set_milestone_status.
- Server never makes outbound network calls.
- Server never reads environment variables for behaviour control.
- lint_content and lint_file produce identical output to pcd-lint CLI
  for identical input, including RULE-01 through RULE-17.
- assess_change_impact applies the decision rules from whitepaper A.19
  deterministically — same inputs always produce the same recommendation.
- All MCP responses are valid JSON-RPC 2.0.

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      stdio transport: stdout contains only MCP JSON-RPC messages
- [observable]      lint_content result is identical to pcd-lint CLI on same input
                    for RULE-01 through RULE-17
- [observable]      set_milestone_status never modifies any content in the spec
                    other than the Status: line of the named milestone
- [observable]      set_milestone_status with new_status=active fails if any other
                    milestone already has Status: active in the same file
- [observable]      server is idempotent: same request always returns same response
- [observable]      server never exits with code other than 0, 1, or 2
- [observable]      assess_change_impact with structural_impact=high always
                    returns recommendation=full-regeneration
- [observable]      verify_spec_hash with matching hashes always returns
                    status="current" and match=true
- [implementation]  rule execution order: RULE-01 through RULE-17, same as pcd-lint
- [implementation]  resource URIs follow pcd://<type>/<n> scheme exactly
- [implementation]  all assets (templates, hints, prompts) are embedded into the
                    binary at build time using a single unified asset embedding
                    mechanism — no distinction in method between asset types
- [implementation]  staged asset directories used during build are not committed
                    to the repository and not required at runtime
- [observable]      GetTemplate, GetHints, and GetPrompt succeed for all assets
                    shipped with the binary, regardless of runtime filesystem state
- [observable]      the binary is fully functional with no pcd-templates package
                    installed and no overlay directories present on the system

## TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS

```
EMBED-ASSETS:
  // All asset types (templates, hints, prompts) are compiled into
  // the binary using the language's native asset embedding mechanism.
  // No distinction in embedding method between asset types.
  //
  // BUILD-TIME LAYOUT:
  //   The build system must stage all assets into a location the
  //   compiler can embed from, relative to the store implementation.
  //   The exact relative paths are implementation-defined — see the
  //   language hints file.
  //
  //   Source of truth in the repository:
  //     repo-root/templates/    (all *.template.md files)
  //     repo-root/hints/        (all *.hints.md files)
  //     repo-root/prompts/      (all *.md prompt files)
  //
  //   The build system copies or links these to the staging location
  //   before compilation. Staged directories are build artefacts only.

  - type: templates
    source: repo-root/templates/*.template.md
    key-derivation: filename stem before ".template.md"
      // e.g. "cli-tool.template.md" -> key "cli-tool"

  - type: hints

## DELIVERABLES

COMPONENT: implementation
  files: main.go, internal/lint/*.go, internal/store/*.go, internal/milestone/*.go
  notes: >
    Split into packages: main (transport wiring), internal/lint
    (rule engine applying RULE-01 through RULE-17, shared with pcd-lint),
    internal/store (unified AssetStore — templates, hints, prompts),
    internal/milestone (set_milestone_status file editing logic),
    internal/changeimpact (assess_change_impact analysis logic).
    Reuse lint rule logic from pcd-lint if available as a library;
    otherwise inline. The lint engine must implement all 17 rules.

COMPONENT: module
  files: go.mod
  notes: Direct dependencies only. go mod tidy required before building.

COMPONENT: build
  files: Makefile
  notes: >
    Must include an embed-assets target that stages templates, hints,
    and prompts into the build-time embedding location before go build.
    Must include a clean target that removes staged directories.
    See hints/mcp-server.go.mcp-go.hints.md for exact paths and commands.

COMPONENT: packaging
  files: mcp-server-pcd.spec, debian/control, debian/changelog,
         debian/rules, debian/copyright
  notes: >
    Source0: mcp-server-pcd-{version}.tar.xz
    Source1: mcp-server-pcd-{version}-vendor.tar.xz
    Vendor tarball generated by: go mod vendor &&
      tar -cJf mcp-server-pcd-{version}-vendor.tar.xz vendor/
    RPM %build must run make embed-assets before go build.
    Requires: (none). Recommends: pcd-templates.

COMPONENT: container
  files: Containerfile
  notes: >
    Multi-stage build. Builder FROM registry.suse.com/bci/golang:latest.
    Final stage FROM scratch.
    EXPOSE 8080. ENTRYPOINT defaults to http transport.

COMPONENT: service-unit
  files: mcp-server-pcd.service
  notes: systemd unit for http transport; socket activation optional.

COMPONENT: license
  files: LICENSE
  notes: GPL-2.0-only — SPDX identifier and URL only, do not reproduce full text.

COMPONENT: tests
  files: independent_tests/INDEPENDENT_TESTS.go
  notes: >
    All tests use FakeStore, FakeFilesystem.
    No filesystem access. No network calls. No live pcd-lint binary.
    Must include TestLintMatchesCLI (verifies lint_content invariant).
    Must include TestSetMilestoneStatus (verifies file editing invariants).
    FakeFilesystem must support both ReadFile and WriteFile.

COMPONENT: documentation

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: Linux service (http transport) or subprocess (stdio transport).

Install locations:
  Binary:        /usr/bin/mcp-server-pcd
  System config: /etc/pcd/
  Service unit:  /usr/lib/systemd/system/mcp-server-pcd.service

The binary embeds all templates, hints, and prompts at build time.
It is self-contained and functional without pcd-templates installed.

Install pcd-templates to enable site-local asset overrides:
  Templates:  /usr/share/pcd/templates/   (pcd-templates)
  Hints:      /usr/share/pcd/hints/        (pcd-templates)
  Prompts:    /usr/share/pcd/prompts/      (pcd-templates)

Runtime dependency:
  Requires:    (none — binary is self-contained)
  Recommends:  pcd-templates

Asset overlay search path (last-wins, ascending precedence):
  1. /usr/share/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/   (pcd-templates)
  2. /etc/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/          (system administrator)
  3. ~/.config/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/     (user)
  4. ./.pcd/templates|hints|prompts/            (project-local)
  Directories that do not exist are silently skipped.

mcphost config (stdio):
```yaml
mcpServers:
  pcd:
    command: mcp-server-pcd
    args: [stdio]
```

mcphost config (http, if running as service):
```yaml
mcpServers:
  pcd:
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp
```

Version in preset hierarchy:
  Specs reference the server by connecting to it — no version declaration
  in the spec itself. Server advertises schema version via get_schema_version.
