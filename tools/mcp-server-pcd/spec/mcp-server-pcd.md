## TYPES

```
TemplateName := string
// Known values: cli-tool, mcp-server, cloud-native, verified-library,
// library-c-abi, python-tool, project-manifest, and any user-installed
// template. Unknown names return TemplateNotFound.

TemplateVersion := string
// Semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) or "latest".
// "latest" resolves to the highest installed version.

HintsKey := string
// Format: "<template>.<language>.<library>"
// Example: "cloud-native.go.go-libvirt"

ResourceURI := string
// Format: "pcd://<type>/<n>"
// Types: templates, prompts, hints
// Examples:
//   pcd://templates/cli-tool
//   pcd://prompts/interview
//   pcd://prompts/translator
//   pcd://hints/cloud-native.go.go-libvirt

## INTERFACES

```
Filesystem {
  // Optional interface — used only when lint_file is called.
  // Not required for lint_content, resource serving, or tool listing.
  required-methods:
    ReadFile(path) -> (content: string, error)
  implementations-required:
    production:  OSFilesystem
    test-double: FakeFilesystem {
      configurable: Files map[string]string, ReadErr map[string]error
    }
}

AssetStore {
  // Provides templates, hints, and prompt content to all MCP tools.
  //
  // ASSET EMBEDDING (build-time):
  //   All assets (templates, hints, prompts) are compiled into the
  //   binary at build time using the language's native asset embedding
  //   mechanism. The binary is self-contained and fully functional
  //   with no pcd-templates package installed at runtime.
  //
  //   The build system stages assets into a location the compiler can
  //   embed from, relative to the store implementation. The exact
  //   mechanism is implementation-defined — see the language hints file.
  //
  //   Staged asset directories are build artefacts only:
  //     - populated by the build system before compilation
  //     - listed in .gitignore
  //     - removed by the clean target
  //     - never committed to the repository
  //     - not required at runtime
  //
  // RUNTIME OVERLAYS (optional, site-local):
  //   After serving embedded assets, the implementation checks
  //   filesystem overlay directories and applies them with last-wins
  //   precedence. All overlay directories are optional — their absence
  //   is not an error.
  //
  //   Overlay search order (ascending precedence):
  //     /usr/share/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     /etc/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     ~/.config/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //     ./.pcd/templates|hints|prompts/
  //
  //   A filesystem entry with the same key as an embedded entry
  //   replaces it. New keys in the filesystem are added alongside
  //   embedded entries.

  required-methods:
    ListTemplates()              -> ([]TemplateRecord, error)
    GetTemplate(name, version)   -> (TemplateRecord, error)
    GetHints(key: string)        -> (content: string, error)

       message "filename must have .md extension".
  3. Run all pcd-lint rules (RULE-01 through RULE-14) against content.
     MECHANISM: identical rule set and logic to the pcd-lint CLI;
     no network calls; no filesystem access; pure in-memory validation.
  4. Assemble LintResult with valid, errors, warnings, diagnostics.
  5. Return LintResult as JSON.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - valid = true iff errors = 0.
  - Every Diagnostic has severity, line, section, message, rule.

ERRORS:
  - -32602  filename missing .md extension

---

## BEHAVIOR: lint_file
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  path:    string    // absolute or relative filesystem path to a .md file

PRECONDITIONS:
  - path is a non-empty string
  - Filesystem is accessible

STEPS:
  1. If path does not end in ".md": return MCP error -32602,

  4. Return LintResult.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - Same as lint_content postconditions.
  - Filesystem is never modified.

ERRORS:
  - -32602  Missing .md extension, file not found
  - -32603  Filesystem read error

---

## BEHAVIOR: get_schema_version
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  none

STEPS:
  1. Return the Spec-Schema version this server was built against
     as a plain string.
     MECHANISM: value is compiled in as a constant; no runtime lookup.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - Response is a semantic version string, e.g. "0.3.19".

ERRORS:
  none

---

## BEHAVIOR: set_milestone_status
Constraint: required

Sets the `Status:` field of a named MILESTONE section in a spec file on disk.
Used by the agent pipeline to advance the milestone cursor without human
intervention.

INPUTS:
```
spec_path:        string          // absolute path to the spec .md file
milestone_name:   string          // exact MILESTONE label, e.g. "0.1.0"
new_status:       MilestoneStatus // pending | active | failed | released
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- spec_path exists and is readable and writable
- spec_path has .md extension
- milestone_name matches an existing ## MILESTONE: section in the file
- new_status is a valid MilestoneStatus value

STEPS:
1. Read spec_path from disk via Filesystem.ReadFile; on error → MCP error -32602.
2. Locate the `## MILESTONE: {milestone_name}` section; on not found →
   MCP error -32602 with message "MILESTONE '{milestone_name}' not found in {spec_path}".
3. If new_status = "active": scan all other MILESTONE sections in the file.
   If any other section already has `Status: active` →
   MCP error -32602 with message
   "Cannot set MILESTONE '{milestone_name}' to active: MILESTONE '{other}' is
    already active. Set it to released or failed first."
4. Record previous_status (current Status: value, or "pending" if absent).
5. Replace or insert the `Status: {value}` line within the located MILESTONE section.
   MECHANISM: the Status: line must be the first non-blank line after the
   ## MILESTONE: header line. If no Status: line is present, insert one.
   Do not modify any other content in the file.
6. Write the modified content back to spec_path via Filesystem.WriteFile;
   on error → MCP error -32603.
7. Return SetMilestoneResult.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- spec_path on disk has exactly the Status: value changed for the named milestone
- All other content in the file is byte-for-byte identical to the input
- If new_status = "active", no other milestone in the file has Status: active
- result.previous_status reflects the status before this call
- result.new_status = new_status

ERRORS:
- MCP error -32602 if spec_path not found or not readable
- MCP error -32602 if milestone_name not found in spec
- MCP error -32602 if new_status = "active" and another milestone is already active
- MCP error -32603 if write to spec_path fails

---

## BEHAVIOR: http-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  listen:  ListenAddress    // default: 127.0.0.1:8080

STEPS:
  1. If listen= argument is absent, use 127.0.0.1:8080.
  2. Bind HTTP listener on listen address.
     On bind failure: write error to stderr and exit 1.
  3. Serve MCP Streamable HTTP transport on /mcp endpoint.
  4. On SIGTERM or SIGINT: stop accepting new connections,
     complete in-flight requests, then exit 0.
     MECHANISM: graceful shutdown with 10-second drain timeout.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - All tools and resources are accessible via HTTP POST to /mcp.
  - Server exits 0 on clean shutdown.

ERRORS:
  - exit 1  bind failure

---

## BEHAVIOR: stdio-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
  none    // transport is selected by bare-word argument "stdio"

STEPS:
  1. Serve MCP stdio transport: read JSON-RPC from stdin,
     write responses to stdout.
  2. Diagnostics and startup messages to stderr only.
  3. On EOF on stdin or SIGTERM/SIGINT: flush pending writes and exit 0.

POSTCONDITIONS:
  - stdout contains only valid MCP JSON-RPC messages.
  - Server exits 0 on clean shutdown.

ERRORS:
  none

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- Invocation provides exactly one transport selector:
    bare word "stdio" → stdio transport
    bare word "http"  → http transport
    (default if neither: stdio)
- If both are given: write error to stderr and exit 2.
- If listen= is given without "http": write warning to stderr, ignore.

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- Server never modifies any file on disk.
- Server never makes outbound network calls.
- Server never reads environment variables for behaviour control.
- lint_content and lint_file produce identical output to pcd-lint CLI
  for identical input.
- All MCP responses are valid JSON-RPC 2.0.

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      stdio transport: stdout contains only MCP JSON-RPC messages
- [observable]      lint_content result is identical to pcd-lint CLI on same input
- [observable]      set_milestone_status never modifies any content in the spec
                    other than the Status: line of the named milestone
- [observable]      set_milestone_status with new_status=active fails if any other
                    milestone already has Status: active in the same file
- [observable]      server is idempotent: same request always returns same response
- [observable]      server never exits with code other than 0, 1, or 2
- [implementation]  rule execution order: RULE-01 through RULE-14, same as pcd-lint
- [implementation]  resource URIs follow pcd://<type>/<n> scheme exactly
- [implementation]  all assets (templates, hints, prompts) are embedded into the
                    binary at build time using a single unified asset embedding
                    mechanism — no distinction in method between asset types
- [implementation]  staged asset directories used during build are not committed
                    to the repository and not required at runtime
- [observable]      GetTemplate, GetHints, and GetPrompt succeed for all assets
                    shipped with the binary, regardless of runtime filesystem state
- [observable]      the binary is fully functional with no pcd-templates package
                    installed and no overlay directories present on the system

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: Linux service (http transport) or subprocess (stdio transport).

Install locations:
  Binary:        /usr/bin/mcp-server-pcd
  System config: /etc/pcd/
  Service unit:  /usr/lib/systemd/system/mcp-server-pcd.service

The binary embeds all templates, hints, and prompts at build time.
It is self-contained and functional without pcd-templates installed.

Install pcd-templates to enable site-local asset overrides:
  Templates:  /usr/share/pcd/templates/   (pcd-templates)
  Hints:      /usr/share/pcd/hints/        (pcd-templates)
  Prompts:    /usr/share/pcd/prompts/      (pcd-templates)

Runtime dependency:
  Requires:    (none — binary is self-contained)
  Recommends:  pcd-templates

Asset overlay search path (last-wins, ascending precedence):
  1. /usr/share/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/   (pcd-templates)
  2. /etc/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/          (system administrator)
  3. ~/.config/pcd/templates|hints|prompts/     (user)
  4. ./.pcd/templates|hints|prompts/            (project-local)
  Directories that do not exist are silently skipped.

mcphost config (stdio):
```yaml
mcpServers:
  pcd:
    command: mcp-server-pcd
    args: [stdio]
```

mcphost config (http, if running as service):
```yaml
mcpServers:
  pcd:
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp
```

Version in preset hierarchy:
  Specs reference the server by connecting to it — no version declaration
  in the spec itself. Server advertises schema version via get_schema_version.
