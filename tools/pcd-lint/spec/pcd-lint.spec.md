pcd-lint is a thin CLI front end over the shared PCD engine (libpcd,
see DEPENDENCIES). All rule semantics - RULE-01 through RULE-25,
include resolution, hashing, TYPE-table validation - live in libpcd's
merged specification (lint-rules.md, types-table-rules.md,
types-emit-rules.md via libpcd's Includes). This spec adds argument
handling, diagnostic rendering, exit codes, the template listing, and
packaging - nothing else. Until v0.4.x this spec included
lint-rules.md directly; the inclusion moved to libpcd.spec.md with
the v0.5.0 restructuring (doc/technical-reference.md, section 20).

---

## TYPES

```
SpecFile := path where file_exists AND readable AND extension = ".md"

TemplatePath := path
// The directory where deployment template files are found.
// All four directories are searched; later entries take precedence (last-wins).
// This means project-local templates override user templates, which override
// system templates, which override the vendor default.
//
// Search order (ascending precedence):
//   1. /usr/share/pcd/templates/    vendor default (pcd-templates package)
//   2. /etc/pcd/templates/          system administrator additions
//   3. ~/.config/pcd/templates/     user additions
//   4. ./.pcd/templates/            project-local
//
// Directories that do not exist are silently skipped.
// v1 supports Linux only. macOS and Windows paths deferred to v2.
//
// Implementation: templateSearchDirs() returns the list of existing dirs
// in ascending precedence order. findTemplateFile(name) returns the path
// of the last match found across all dirs (not the first). This ensures
// project-local templates override installed ones.

ExitCode := 0 | 1 | 2
// 0 = valid (no errors; no warnings when strict=true)
// 1 = invalid (at least one Error; or strict=true and at least one Warning)
// 2 = invocation error (bad arguments, file not found, unreadable file)

LintResult := {
  file:        SpecFile,
  diagnostics: List<Diagnostic>,
  exit_code:   ExitCode
}

// Contract mirrors - authoritative definitions live in libpcd's merged
// specification (lint-rules.md). Kept here so this spec is
// self-contained for translation; the library definition governs.
Severity := Error | Warning

Diagnostic := {
  severity: Severity,
  section:  string,
  line:     u32 where line > 0,
  message:  string,
  rule:     string
}
```

Note: Multiple BEHAVIOR and BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections are permitted.
Each describes a distinct operation or internal rule of the component.
All BEHAVIOR sections share the TYPES, INVARIANTS, and EXAMPLES
sections of this specification. BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections describe
implementation logic not directly exposed to the user; they are
validated with identical structural rules to BEHAVIOR sections.

### Currently-shipped templates

The set of templates known to this build. The list is mechanically
derived from `templates/` by `make spec`; do not hand-edit between the
markers.

## INTERFACES

```
SpecEngine {
  // Provided by libpcd (see DEPENDENCIES). Subset consumed by this
  // front end; signatures per libpcd.spec.md INTERFACES.
  required-methods:
    LoadSpec(path)         -> (SpecModel, error)
    Lint(model, options)   -> []Diagnostic
    SchemaVersion()        -> string
  implementations-required:
    production:  libpcd (pinned; see DEPENDENCIES)
    test-double: FakeEngine {
      configurable: Models map[string]SpecModel,
                    Diags map[string][]Diagnostic,
                    Errs map[string]error
    }
}
```

---

## BEHAVIOR: lint
Constraint: required

The primary operation. Validates a specification file against the
structural rules defined in libpcd's merged specification
(RULE-01 through RULE-25).

INPUTS:
```
file:   SpecFile
strict: bool     // strict=true treats warnings as errors; default false
check_report: bool // check-report=true evaluates RULE-18; default false
```

OUTPUTS:
```
result: LintResult
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- file exists and is readable
- file has `.md` extension
- strict is a valid boolean (true | false)
- check_report is a valid boolean (true | false)

STEPS:
1. Verify file has `.md` extension; on failure → exit 2 with
   "error: file must have .md extension: {path}".
2. Open and read file; on failure → exit 2 with
   "error: cannot open file: {path}".
3. Load the spec via LoadSpec(file) and collect all diagnostics from
   Lint(model, options): RULE-01 through RULE-21 in order, plus
   RULE-22 through RULE-25 when the merged TYPES section contains
   TYPE tables. check_report maps to RULE-18.
   Rules are not short-circuited — all rules run regardless of earlier errors.
4. Sort diagnostics by line number (monotonically non-decreasing).
5. Write each diagnostic to stderr in the defined format.
6. Compute exit_code: 1 if any Error present, or (strict=true AND any Warning); else 0.
7. Write summary line to stdout in the defined format.
8. Exit with exit_code.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- result.file = file
- result.exit_code = 0 iff result.diagnostics contains no Error
  AND (strict = false OR result.diagnostics contains no Warning)
- result.exit_code = 1 iff result.diagnostics contains at least one Error,
  OR (strict = true AND result.diagnostics contains at least one Warning)
- diagnostics are written to stderr, one line per diagnostic
- summary line is written to stdout
- order of diagnostics follows order of appearance in file
- input file is not modified

SIDE-EFFECTS:
- stderr: diagnostic lines (errors and warnings), if any
- stdout: summary line (always emitted, see DEPLOYMENT for format)
- no network calls
- no environment variable reads for behaviour control

---

## BEHAVIOR: list-templates
Constraint: required

Prints all known deployment templates with their resolved default
target language. Useful for discovering valid Deployment: values.

INPUTS:
```
none
```

OUTPUTS:
```
stdout: list of template names with default language annotations
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- none

STEPS:
1. Call templateSearchDirs() to obtain the ordered list of existing template
   directories (ascending precedence; later entries override earlier).
   MECHANISM: templateSearchDirs() checks each of the four candidate paths
   (/usr/share/pcd/templates, /etc/pcd/templates, ~/.config/pcd/templates,
   ./.pcd/templates) and includes only those that exist as directories.
2. For each template T in defined order:
   a. Call findTemplateFile(T) to locate the companion `{T}.template.md`.
      MECHANISM: findTemplateFile(name) iterates templateSearchDirs() and
      records the path of each match found; returns the last match (highest
      precedence). Returns "" if no match in any directory.
   b. If found: call readDefaultLanguage(path) to extract the default language.
      MECHANISM: readDefaultLanguage(path) reads the file, locates the
      ## TEMPLATE-TABLE section, and returns the value from the first row
      where key=LANGUAGE and constraint=default. Returns "" if not found.
      If readDefaultLanguage returns "": annotation = "(installed)".
      If found: annotation = returned language string.
      If findTemplateFile returned "": annotation = "(template file not found)".
   c. For special values (enhance-existing, manual, template, project-manifest):
      use the fixed annotation defined in POSTCONDITIONS regardless of
      whether a companion file exists.
3. Write one line per template to stdout in format: "{T}  →  {annotation}".
4. Exit 0.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- exit_code = 0 always
- stdout line count matches the count phrase below
- each line format: "<template-name>  →  <default-language>"

<!-- BEGIN AUTO: known-templates-count -->
exactly 14 lines, one per known DeploymentTemplate value
<!-- END AUTO: known-templates-count -->

- for enhance-existing: "<template-name>  →  (declare Language: in META)"
- for manual:           "<template-name>  →  (declare Target: in META)"
- for template:         "<template-name>  →  (template definition file, not translatable)"
- for project-manifest: "<template-name>  →  (architect artifact, no code generated)"
- nothing written to stderr

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- For lint: file argument must be provided
- For lint: file must exist and be readable by the current process
- For lint: file must have .md extension
- For lint: if file does not have .md extension:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: file must have .md extension: {path}"
- For list-templates: no file argument required
- key=value arguments must use recognised keys (see DEPLOYMENT)
- unrecognised key=value pairs: exit 2, message to stderr

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- pcd-lint does not modify any file on disk
- pcd-lint does not make network calls
- pcd-lint does not read environment variables for behaviour control
- exit code is always 0, 1, or 2; no other values
- on file-not-found or unreadable:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: cannot open file: {path}"
- on file without .md extension:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: file must have .md extension: {path}"
- on missing file argument (without list-templates):
    exit 2, write to stderr: usage line (see DEPLOYMENT)
- on unrecognised key=value argument:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: unrecognised option: {key}"

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      pcd-lint is idempotent — running it twice on the same file
  produces identical output and identical exit code
- [observable]      all Error diagnostics produce exit_code ≥ 1
- [observable]      Warnings alone never produce exit_code = 1 unless strict=true
- [observable]      exit_code = 1 with only Warnings requires strict=true
- [observable]      exit_code = 2 indicates invocation error only,
  never a lint result
- [observable]      diagnostic line numbers are monotonically non-decreasing
  within a result
- [observable]      pcd-lint never produces exit_code = 0 when any Error
  diagnostic is present, regardless of strict value
- [observable]      stderr receives diagnostics; stdout receives summary and
  list-templates output; these streams are never swapped

## DEPENDENCIES

- name: libpcd
  kind: pcd-artifact
  spec: ../../libpcd/spec/libpcd.spec.md
  version: 0.1.0
  do-not-fabricate: true
  provenance: >
    Build-time dependency on a PCD-built library. The
    TRANSLATION_REPORT of this tool must record
    `Dependency-libpcd-Version:` and `Dependency-libpcd-Spec-SHA256:`
    (the merged spec hash of the libpcd spec at the pinned version),
    extending the translation-input provenance chain across the two
    translation units. The build service enforces version alignment
    across all libpcd consumers.
  notes: >
    Public interface: SpecEngine (see INTERFACES here and
    libpcd.spec.md). Per-language import path and linkage are
    hints-layer concerns.

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: command-line tool, single static binary; libpcd is linked at
build time

Parsing approach:
  Spec parsing, include resolution, hashing, and rule evaluation are
  provided by libpcd (see DEPENDENCIES). The parsing conventions -
  fence-depth code-fence exclusion and column-0 marker recognition -
  are normative in libpcd's merged specification and bind the engine,
  not this front end. This front end parses only its own command
  line. Translators document the engine binding in the translation
  report.

Template search path:
  All four directories are searched; later entries take precedence (last-wins).
  Directories that do not exist are silently skipped.
  Search order (ascending precedence):
    1. /usr/share/pcd/templates/    vendor default (pcd-templates package)
    2. /etc/pcd/templates/          system administrator
    3. ~/.config/pcd/templates/     user
    4. ./.pcd/templates/            project-local
  Platform: Linux only in v1.

Runtime dependency:
  Requires: pcd-templates
  The pcd-templates package installs template and hints files to
  /usr/share/pcd/templates/ and /usr/share/pcd/hints/.
  pcd-lint reads templates from the search path at runtime.
  pcd-lint does not install template or hints files itself.

Invocation:
  pcd-lint <specfile.md>
  pcd-lint strict=true <specfile.md>
  pcd-lint check-report=true <specfile.md>
  pcd-lint strict=true check-report=true <specfile.md>
  pcd-lint list-templates

Key=value options (all optional, precede the file argument):
  strict=true          Treat warnings as errors; exit 1 on warnings
                       Default: strict=false
  check-report=true    Also evaluate RULE-18: look for TRANSLATION_REPORT.md
                       adjacent to the spec, verify Spec-SHA256 field presence
                       and hash currency. Emits warnings only; never errors.
                       Default: check-report=false

Commands (bare words, no file argument):
  list-templates  Print all known deployment templates and exit 0
                  Note: language defaults for templates other than
                  cli-tool require companion *.template.md files
                  to be present in the template search path.
                  If a companion file is absent, the annotation
                  "(template file not found)" is emitted for that entry.
  version         Print pcd-lint version, Spec-Schema version, and
                  embedded SPDX list version, then exit 0.
                  The Spec-Schema version is obtained from SchemaVersion().
                  Format: pcd-lint {version} (schema {spec-schema}) spdx/{spdx-version}

Output streams:
  stderr: diagnostic lines (errors and warnings)
  stdout: summary line (lint) or template list (list-templates)

Diagnostic line format (stderr):
  {SEVERITY}  {file}:{line}  [{section}]  {message}

  Examples:
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:1    [structure]  Missing required section: ## INVARIANTS
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:4    [META]       Missing required META field: Deployment
    WARNING  account_transfer.md:6    [META]       META field 'Target' is deprecated since v0.3.0
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:42   [EXAMPLES]   Example 'foo' missing THEN: marker

Summary line format (stdout):
// This format is normative. Implementations must match exactly.
// See also: BEHAVIOR: lint POSTCONDITIONS.
  ✓ {file}: valid                                        exit 0, no warnings
  ✓ {file}: valid ({N} warning(s))                       exit 0, warnings present, strict=false
  ✗ {file}: {N} error(s), {M} warning(s)                 exit 1, strict=false
  ✗ {file}: {N} error(s), {M} warning(s) [strict mode]   exit 1, strict=true

Installation:
  OBS package: pcd-tools
  Available for: openSUSE Leap, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu
  No curl-based installation.
  Requires: pcd-templates (provides template and hints files)
    openSUSE/SLES default install path: /usr/share/pcd/templates/

Platform:
  Linux (primary)
  macOS (supported, template path TBD in v2)
  Windows (not supported in v1)

Signal handling note:
  SIGNAL-HANDLING: SIGTERM and SIGINT are declared required in the
  cli-tool template. In practice all tested translators omitted this
  or noted it as a deviation. For v1, clean exit on SIGTERM/SIGINT
  is required but acceptable to implement as the Go/C runtime default
  behaviour (no explicit handler needed for a short-lived CLI tool
  that does not hold open file handles or sockets). Translators must
  document signal handling approach in the translation report.
