## TYPES

```
SpecFile := path where file_exists AND readable AND extension = ".md"

Section := string where matches("^## [A-Z][A-Z0-9-]+")

TemplatePath := path
// The directory where deployment template files are found.
// Set at compile time via build variable TEMPLATE_DIR.
// Default (Linux): /usr/share/pcdp/templates/
// Runtime search order (first match wins):
//   1. TEMPLATE_DIR (compile-time default, read-only)
//   2. /etc/pcdp/templates/       (system administrator additions)
//   3. ~/.config/pcdp/templates/  (user additions)

```

Note: Multiple BEHAVIOR and BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections are permitted.
Each describes a distinct operation or internal rule of the component.
All BEHAVIOR sections share the TYPES, INVARIANTS, and EXAMPLES
sections of this specification. BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections describe
implementation logic not directly exposed to the user; they are
validated with identical structural rules to BEHAVIOR sections.

---

## BEHAVIOR: lint
Constraint: required

The primary operation. Validates a specification file against the
structural rules defined in this specification.

INPUTS:
```
file:   SpecFile
strict: bool     // strict=true treats warnings as errors; default false
```

OUTPUTS:
```
result: LintResult
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- file exists and is readable
- file has `.md` extension
- strict is a valid boolean (true | false)

STEPS:
1. Verify file has `.md` extension; on failure → exit 2 with
   "error: file must have .md extension: {path}".
2. Open and read file; on failure → exit 2 with
   "error: cannot open file: {path}".
3. Apply RULE-01 through RULE-13 in order; collect all diagnostics.
   Rules are not short-circuited — all rules run regardless of earlier errors.
4. Sort diagnostics by line number (monotonically non-decreasing).
5. Write each diagnostic to stderr in the defined format.
6. Compute exit_code: 1 if any Error present, or (strict=true AND any Warning); else 0.
7. Write summary line to stdout in the defined format.
8. Exit with exit_code.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- result.file = file
- result.exit_code = 0 iff result.diagnostics contains no Error
  AND (strict = false OR result.diagnostics contains no Warning)
- result.exit_code = 1 iff result.diagnostics contains at least one Error,
  OR (strict = true AND result.diagnostics contains at least one Warning)
- diagnostics are written to stderr, one line per diagnostic
- summary line is written to stdout
- order of diagnostics follows order of appearance in file
- input file is not modified

SIDE-EFFECTS:
- stderr: diagnostic lines (errors and warnings), if any
- stdout: summary line (always emitted, see DEPLOYMENT for format)
- no network calls
- no environment variable reads for behaviour control

---

## BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL: code-fence-tracking
Constraint: required

Tracks whether the parser is currently inside a code-fenced block
and suppresses all structural detection while inside one.

STEPS:
1. Initialise inFence = false.
2. For each line L in the file:
   a. If L begins with ``` or ~~~:
      toggle inFence (false→true or true→false); skip to next line.
   b. If inFence = true: skip L entirely — no pattern matching.
   c. If inFence = false: pass L to all structural detection rules.

---

## BEHAVIOR: list-templates
Constraint: required

Prints all known deployment templates with their resolved default
target language. Useful for discovering valid Deployment: values.

INPUTS:
```
none
```

OUTPUTS:
```
stdout: list of template names with default language annotations
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- none

STEPS:
1. Load the canonical DeploymentTemplate value list.
2. For each template T in defined order:
   a. Attempt to locate companion `{T}.template.md` in the template search path.
   b. If found: read default language from its TEMPLATE-TABLE.
      If not found: annotation = "(template file not found)".
   c. For special values (enhance-existing, manual, template, project-manifest):
      use the fixed annotation defined in POSTCONDITIONS.
3. Write one line per template to stdout in format: "{T}  →  {annotation}".
4. Exit 0.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- exit_code = 0 always
- stdout contains exactly 17 lines, one per known DeploymentTemplate value
- each line format: "<template-name>  →  <default-language>"
- for enhance-existing: "<template-name>  →  (declare Language: in META)"
- for manual:           "<template-name>  →  (declare Target: in META)"
- for template:         "<template-name>  →  (template definition file, not translatable)"
- for project-manifest: "<template-name>  →  (architect artifact, no code generated)"
- nothing written to stderr

---

## BEHAVIOR: lint-validation-rules
Constraint: required

Defines the ordered set of structural rules applied during lint.
All rules are evaluated; lint does not stop at first error.

STEPS:
1. Apply RULE-01 (required sections present).
2. Apply RULE-02 through RULE-02e (META fields).
3. Apply RULE-03 (deployment template resolves).
4. Apply RULE-04 (deprecated META fields).
5. Apply RULE-05 (Verification field value).
6. Apply RULE-06 (EXAMPLES section structure, including multi-pass).
7. Apply RULE-07 (EXAMPLES minimum content).
8. Apply RULE-08 (BEHAVIOR blocks contain STEPS).
9. Apply RULE-09 (INVARIANTS entries carry observable/implementation tags).
10. Apply RULE-10 (negative-path EXAMPLE required for BEHAVIOR with error exits).
11. Apply RULE-11 (TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS section structure, if present).
12. Apply RULE-12 (cross-section consistency: identifiers, types, file names).
13. Apply RULE-13 (Constraint: field value on BEHAVIOR headers).
    MECHANISM: rules are independent; a failure in one rule does not prevent
    subsequent rules from running. All diagnostics are collected before output.

### RULE-01: Required sections present

REQUIRED_SECTIONS :=
  [ "## META", "## TYPES", "## BEHAVIOR", "## PRECONDITIONS",
    "## POSTCONDITIONS", "## INVARIANTS", "## EXAMPLES" ]

For each section S in REQUIRED_SECTIONS:
  if S not present in file:
    emit Error, section="structure", line=1,
      message="Missing required section: {S}"
// line=1 is the canonical value for missing-section diagnostics.
// The section does not exist, so no line can be identified;
// line=1 signals a file-level structural error to the caller.

Note: "## BEHAVIOR" is satisfied by the presence of one or more
BEHAVIOR sections. The following BEHAVIOR variants are all recognised
and valid:
  - "## BEHAVIOR: <name>"          user-facing operation
  - "## BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL: <name>" internal implementation logic,
                                   not directly user-facing

Multiple BEHAVIOR and BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections are permitted and
may be freely mixed. Section headers must appear at the start of a
line. Case is significant (BEHAVIOR uppercase required).
BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections are validated with identical structural
rules to BEHAVIOR sections.

### RULE-02: META fields present and non-empty

REQUIRED_META_FIELDS :=
  [ "Deployment", "Verification", "Safety-Level",
    "Version", "Spec-Schema", "License" ]
// Note: Author is required (at least one) but uses repeating-key pattern.
// See RULE-02b below.

For each field F in REQUIRED_META_FIELDS:
  if F not present in META section:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Missing required META field: {F}"
  if value of F is empty:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="META field {F} has empty value"

### RULE-02b: Author field

if no "Author:" line present in META section:
  emit Error, section="META",
    message="Missing required META field: Author (at least one Author: line required)"

// Multiple Author: lines are permitted and collected as a list.
// Each Author: value must be non-empty.
For each Author: line A in META section:
  if value of A is empty:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Author: field has empty value"

### RULE-02c: Version format

Let V = value of META field "Version"
if V does not match SemanticVersion pattern "^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$":
  emit Error, section="META",
    message="Version '{V}' is not valid semantic versioning. \
             Required format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 0.1.0)"

### RULE-02d: Spec-Schema version

Let S = value of META field "Spec-Schema"
if S does not match SemanticVersion pattern "^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$":
  emit Error, section="META",
    message="Spec-Schema '{S}' is not valid semantic versioning. \
             Required format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 0.1.0)"

// v2 note: validate Spec-Schema against list of known schema versions
// and warn if spec was written against an older schema than current.

### RULE-02e: License SPDX validation

Let L = value of META field "License"

if L is not a valid SPDX license identifier or compound expression:
  emit Error, section="META",
    message="License '{L}' is not a valid SPDX identifier. \
             See https://spdx.org/licenses/ for valid identifiers. \
             Compound expressions permitted (e.g. Apache-2.0 OR MIT)."

// pcdp-lint embeds the SPDX license list at build time.
// The embedded list version is reported in pcdp-lint version output.

### RULE-03: Deployment template resolves

Let D = value of META field "Deployment"

if D = "crypto-library":
  emit Error, section="META", line=1,
    message="Deployment 'crypto-library' was retired in 0.3.6. \
             Use 'verified-library' instead. \
             verified-library covers all safety- and security-critical \
             C-ABI libraries including cryptographic primitives."

if D not in DeploymentTemplate:
  emit Error, section="META",
    message="Unknown deployment template: '{D}'. \
             Run 'pcdp-lint list-templates' to see valid values."

if D = "enhance-existing":
  if META field "Language" not present:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Deployment 'enhance-existing' requires META field 'Language'"
  if value of "Language" is empty:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="META field 'Language' has empty value"

if D = "manual":
  if META field "Target" not present:
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Deployment 'manual' requires META field 'Target' \
               (no template available for language resolution)"

if D = "python-tool":
  let SL = value of META field "Safety-Level"
  if SL ≠ "QM":
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Deployment 'python-tool' requires Safety-Level: QM. \
               Python is not suitable for safety-critical components."
  let V = value of META field "Verification"
  if V ≠ "none":
    emit Error, section="META",
      message="Deployment 'python-tool' requires Verification: none. \
               No formal verification path exists for Python."

if D = "verified-library":
  let SL = value of META field "Safety-Level"
  if SL = "QM":
    emit Warning, section="META",
      message="Deployment 'verified-library' with Safety-Level: QM is unusual. \
               verified-library is intended for safety- or security-critical \
               components. Consider using library-c-abi for general-purpose libraries."

### RULE-04: Deprecated META fields

if META field "Target" is present AND D ≠ "manual":
  emit Warning, section="META",
    message="META field 'Target' is deprecated since v0.3.0. \
             Target language is derived from the deployment template. \
             Remove 'Target', or switch to Deployment: manual \
             if explicit language control is required."

if META field "Domain" is present:
  emit Warning, section="META",
    message="META field 'Domain' is deprecated since v0.3.0. \
             Use 'Deployment' instead."

### RULE-05: Verification field value

KNOWN_VERIFICATION_VALUES := [ "none", "lean4", "fstar", "dafny", "custom" ]

Let V = value of META field "Verification"

if V not in KNOWN_VERIFICATION_VALUES:
  emit Warning, section="META",
    message="Unknown verification value: '{V}'. \
             Known values: none, lean4, fstar, dafny, custom. \
             Custom verification backends are permitted; \
             verify the value is intentional."

### RULE-06: EXAMPLES section structure

The ## EXAMPLES section must contain at least one example block.

An example block consists of:
  - a line matching "^EXAMPLE:" (example name declaration)
  - at least one WHEN:/THEN: pair appearing after GIVEN:
  - WHEN: and THEN: must alternate: each WHEN: must be followed by
    its matching THEN: before the next WHEN: or end of block
  (Multi-pass examples with multiple WHEN/THEN pairs are valid — v0.3.12+)

if no example block found:
  emit Error, section="EXAMPLES",
    message="EXAMPLES section contains no example blocks. \
             Each example requires EXAMPLE:, GIVEN:, WHEN:, THEN: markers."

For each example block E:
  if E missing "GIVEN:":
    emit Error, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' missing GIVEN: marker"
  if E missing at least one "WHEN:":
    emit Error, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' missing WHEN: marker"
  if E missing at least one "THEN:":
    emit Error, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' missing THEN: marker"
  for each WHEN: marker W in E (in order):
    if W is not immediately followed (before next WHEN: or end of block) by a THEN: marker:
      emit Error, section="EXAMPLES",
        message="Example '{n}' has WHEN: without a matching THEN:"

### RULE-07: EXAMPLES minimum content

Block boundaries are defined as follows:
  GIVEN block  := lines strictly between GIVEN: and first WHEN: marker
  WHEN block   := lines strictly between a WHEN: marker and its matching THEN: marker
  THEN block   := lines after a THEN: marker until one of:
                    - next WHEN: marker at start of line (multi-pass)
                    - next EXAMPLE: marker at start of line
                    - next ## heading at start of line
                    - end of file
  A block is empty if it contains zero non-whitespace lines.
  A marker line itself (GIVEN:, WHEN:, THEN:) is not content.

For each example block E:
  if GIVEN block is empty:
    emit Warning, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' has empty GIVEN block"
  if WHEN block is empty:
    emit Warning, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' has empty WHEN block"
  if THEN block is empty:
    emit Warning, section="EXAMPLES",
      message="Example '{n}' has empty THEN block"

### RULE-08: BEHAVIOR blocks must contain STEPS (v0.3.12+)

For each BEHAVIOR or BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL section B:
  if B does not contain a line matching "^STEPS:":
    emit Error, section=B,
      message="BEHAVIOR '{n}' is missing required STEPS: block. \
               Every BEHAVIOR must include ordered, imperative STEPS."

### RULE-09: INVARIANTS entries should carry observable/implementation tags (v0.3.12+)

For each entry line L in the ## INVARIANTS section:
  // An entry line is a non-empty, non-heading line that is not a separator.
  if L does not begin with "- [observable]" AND L does not begin with "- [implementation]":
    emit Warning, section="INVARIANTS",
      message="Invariant entry missing tag. \
               Prefix with [observable] or [implementation] for audit utility."

### RULE-10: Negative-path EXAMPLE required for BEHAVIOR with error exits (v0.3.13+)

For each BEHAVIOR section B:
  let error_exits = lines in B's STEPS block matching "→" (error exit notation)
  if error_exits is non-empty:
    // Collect EXAMPLES that reference this BEHAVIOR (by name or by being the
    // sole BEHAVIOR in the spec). A negative-path EXAMPLE is one whose THEN:
    // block contains at least one of: "Err(", "error", "exit_code = 1",
    // "exit_code = 2", "stderr contains", or a declared ERROR code from B.
    let negative_examples = EXAMPLES referencing B whose THEN block matches
                            negative-path pattern
    if negative_examples is empty:
      emit Error, section=B,
        message="BEHAVIOR '{n}' has error exits in STEPS but no negative-path \
                 EXAMPLE. Add at least one EXAMPLE whose THEN: verifies an \
                 error outcome."

// Note: for specs with a single BEHAVIOR, all EXAMPLES are considered
// to reference that BEHAVIOR. For multi-BEHAVIOR specs, association is
// by name matching between EXAMPLE WHEN: text and BEHAVIOR name.

### RULE-11: TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS section structure (v0.3.13+)

if ## TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS section is present:
  For each entry line L in the section:
    if L declares a constraint value other than "required" or "forbidden":
      emit Warning, section="TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS",
        message="TOOLCHAIN-CONSTRAINTS entry uses unknown constraint value. \
                 Valid values: required, forbidden."
// The section is optional. Its absence is not an error.
// Structural validation is minimal in v0.3.13; semantic validation deferred to v0.4.0.

### RULE-12: Cross-section consistency (v0.3.13+, partial)

**12a — Identifier consistency (warning):**
  Collect all method names declared in ## INTERFACES sections
    (lines matching pattern: "  <MethodName>(")
  For each method name M:
    if M appears in any BEHAVIOR STEPS block in a modified form
       (e.g. "transport.Connect" where M is "Connect"):
      emit Warning, section="BEHAVIOR",
        message="Identifier '{M}' declared in INTERFACES but referenced as \
                 '{variant}' in BEHAVIOR STEPS. Use the declared name verbatim."

**12b — Type name consistency (error):**
  Collect all type names declared in ## TYPES section
    (lines matching "^<TypeName> :=")
  For each type name T:
    if T is redefined (assigned with :=) in any BEHAVIOR section:
      emit Error, section="BEHAVIOR",
        message="Type '{T}' declared in TYPES is redefined in BEHAVIOR. \
                 Types must be declared in TYPES only."

**12c — File name consistency (warning):**
  Collect all file names in ## DELIVERABLES COMPONENT entries
  Collect all file names referenced in ## BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL sections
  For each file name F referenced in BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL but absent from DELIVERABLES:
    emit Warning, section="BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL",
      message="File '{F}' referenced in BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL is not declared \
               in DELIVERABLES. Add a COMPONENT entry or remove the reference."

// State-machine and endpoint semantic consistency deferred to v0.4.0.

### RULE-13: Constraint: field value on BEHAVIOR headers (v0.3.13+)

VALID_CONSTRAINTS := [ "required", "supported", "forbidden" ]

For each BEHAVIOR or BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL section B:
  if B has a line matching "^Constraint:":
    let C = value of Constraint: field
    if C not in VALID_CONSTRAINTS:
      emit Error, section=B,
        message="BEHAVIOR '{n}' has invalid Constraint: value '{C}'. \
                 Valid values: required, supported, forbidden."
    if C = "forbidden":
      if B does not contain a line matching "^  reason:":
        emit Warning, section=B,
          message="BEHAVIOR '{n}' is Constraint: forbidden but has no reason: annotation."
  // Absence of Constraint: field is valid; default is `required`.

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- For lint: file argument must be provided
- For lint: file must exist and be readable by the current process
- For lint: file must have .md extension
- For lint: if file does not have .md extension:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: file must have .md extension: {path}"
- For list-templates: no file argument required
- key=value arguments must use recognised keys (see DEPLOYMENT)
- unrecognised key=value pairs: exit 2, message to stderr

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- pcdp-lint does not modify any file on disk
- pcdp-lint does not make network calls
- pcdp-lint does not read environment variables for behaviour control
- exit code is always 0, 1, or 2; no other values
- on file-not-found or unreadable:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: cannot open file: {path}"
- on file without .md extension:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: file must have .md extension: {path}"
- on missing file argument (without list-templates):
    exit 2, write to stderr: usage line (see DEPLOYMENT)
- on unrecognised key=value argument:
    exit 2, write to stderr: "error: unrecognised option: {key}"

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      pcdp-lint is idempotent — running it twice on the same file
  produces identical output and identical exit code
- [observable]      all Error diagnostics produce exit_code ≥ 1
- [observable]      Warnings alone never produce exit_code = 1 unless strict=true
- [observable]      exit_code = 1 with only Warnings requires strict=true
- [observable]      exit_code = 2 indicates invocation error only,
  never a lint result
- [observable]      diagnostic line numbers are monotonically non-decreasing
  within a result
- [observable]      pcdp-lint never produces exit_code = 0 when any Error
  diagnostic is present, regardless of strict value
- [observable]      stderr receives diagnostics; stdout receives summary and
  list-templates output; these streams are never swapped

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: command-line tool, single static binary, no runtime dependencies

Parsing approach:
  The specification describes validation rule semantics only, not the
  internal parsing implementation. Translators are free to choose any
  parsing strategy — line-by-line state machine, AST, regex, or other.
  The EXAMPLES section is the acceptance test: a correct implementation
  must satisfy all examples regardless of internal parsing approach.
  Common strategies observed in practice:
  - Line-by-line state machine: simple, sufficient for v1 rules
  - Markdown AST parser: more robust for edge cases, higher complexity
  Translators should document their parsing approach in the translation
  report.

  Code-fence exclusion: all content between opening and closing
  code-fence markers (lines beginning with ``` or ~~~) is excluded
  from all structural parsing. No PCDP markers, section headers,
  EXAMPLE:, GIVEN:, WHEN:, THEN:, BEHAVIOR patterns, STEPS:,
  Constraint:, or INVARIANTS entries are recognised inside fenced
  blocks. Translators must implement this as a boolean fence-tracking
  guard in the main parsing loop, toggled at fence boundary lines,
  applied before every structural pattern check.

Template search path (compile-time variable TEMPLATE_DIR):
  Default (Linux): /usr/share/pcdp/templates/
  Runtime search order (first match wins, later entries take precedence):
    1. TEMPLATE_DIR                          compiled-in default
    2. /etc/pcdp/templates/           system administrator
    3. ~/.config/pcdp/templates/      user
    4. ./.pcdp/templates/             project-local
  Platform: Linux only in v1.

Invocation:
  pcdp-lint <specfile.md>
  pcdp-lint strict=true <specfile.md>
  pcdp-lint list-templates

Key=value options (all optional, precede the file argument):
  strict=true     Treat warnings as errors; exit 1 on warnings
                  Default: strict=false

Commands (bare words, no file argument):
  list-templates  Print all known deployment templates and exit 0
                  Note: language defaults for templates other than
                  cli-tool require companion *.template.md files
                  to be present in the template search path.
                  If a companion file is absent, the annotation
                  "(template file not found)" is emitted for that entry.
  version         Print pcdp-lint version, Spec-Schema version, and
                  embedded SPDX list version, then exit 0.
                  Format: pcdp-lint {version} (schema {spec-schema}) spdx/{spdx-version}

Output streams:
  stderr: diagnostic lines (errors and warnings)
  stdout: summary line (lint) or template list (list-templates)

Diagnostic line format (stderr):
  {SEVERITY}  {file}:{line}  [{section}]  {message}

  Examples:
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:1    [structure]  Missing required section: ## INVARIANTS
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:4    [META]       Missing required META field: Deployment
    WARNING  account_transfer.md:6    [META]       META field 'Target' is deprecated since v0.3.0
    ERROR    account_transfer.md:42   [EXAMPLES]   Example 'foo' missing THEN: marker

Summary line format (stdout):
// This format is normative. Implementations must match exactly.
// See also: BEHAVIOR: lint POSTCONDITIONS.
  ✓ {file}: valid                                        exit 0, no warnings
  ✓ {file}: valid ({N} warning(s))                       exit 0, warnings present, strict=false
  ✗ {file}: {N} error(s), {M} warning(s)                 exit 1, strict=false
  ✗ {file}: {N} error(s), {M} warning(s) [strict mode]   exit 1, strict=true

Installation:
  OBS package: pcdp-tools
  Available for: openSUSE Leap, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu
  No curl-based installation.
  Build variable: TEMPLATE_DIR must be set at OBS build time.
    openSUSE/SLES default: /usr/share/pcdp/templates/

Platform:
  Linux (primary)
  macOS (supported, template path TBD in v2)
  Windows (not supported in v1)

Signal handling note:
  SIGNAL-HANDLING: SIGTERM and SIGINT are declared required in the
  cli-tool template. In practice all tested translators omitted this
  or noted it as a deviation. For v1, clean exit on SIGTERM/SIGINT
  is required but acceptable to implement as the Go/C runtime default
  behaviour (no explicit handler needed for a short-lived CLI tool
  that does not hold open file handles or sockets). Translators must
  document signal handling approach in the translation report.
