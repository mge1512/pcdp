## TYPES

```
Language := C | Rust

VerificationLevel := lean4 | fstar | dafny | custom
// Verification: none is NOT permitted for verified-library.
// Minimum: lean4 or equivalent for EAL4+/ASIL-C/D/DAL-A/B contexts.

SafetyLevel := one_of(
  "ASIL-A" | "ASIL-B" | "ASIL-C" | "ASIL-D" |
  "DAL-A" | "DAL-B" | "DAL-C" | "DAL-D" |
  "IEC-62443-SL1" | "IEC-62443-SL2" | "IEC-62443-SL3" | "IEC-62443-SL4" |
  "EAL2" | "EAL3" | "EAL4" | "EAL4+" | "EAL5" | "EAL6" | "EAL7"
)
// Safety-Level: QM is NOT permitted for verified-library.
// Use library-c-abi for general-purpose C libraries without
// safety or security certification requirements.

## DELIVERABLES

*(Full DELIVERABLES section pending — to be completed in v0.3.8)*

Required deliverables will include:
- Source files in target language
- Meta-language IR (Lean 4 / F* / Dafny) — AI-generated, not human-authored
- Formal proof artifacts
- Test vectors (from applicable standard: NIST CAVP, ISO, etc.)
- `<n>.pc` pkg-config file
- `<n>.cps` CPS file (CMake 4.3+)
- RPM spec, Debian package files
- `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md`

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- Safety-Level must not be QM
- Verification must not be none
- Spec must include a SECURITY-PROPERTIES section declaring:
  Constant-Time, Side-Channel-Resistance, Key-Zeroization requirements
- Applicable standard must be declared (FIPS-140-3, NIST, RFC, ISO 26262, etc.)

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

*(Pending — to be completed in v0.3.8)*

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      Safety-Level QM is rejected at spec-lint time
- [observable]      Verification: none is rejected at spec-lint time
- [observable]      verified-library inherits all library-c-abi constraints
  and adds security/safety constraints on top
- [observable]      template version is recorded in every audit bundle

---

## EXAMPLES

*(Pending — to be completed in v0.3.8)*
*(Reference examples: AES-256-GCM, ECDSA P-256, SHA-3, mutex primitive)*

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: this file is a template specification, not executable code.
Location: /usr/share/pcdp/templates/verified-library.template.md
Status: Work in progress — v0.3.8 target for completion.
Supersedes: crypto-library template (retired in v0.3.6).
