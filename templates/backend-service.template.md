## BEHAVIOR: resolve
Constraint: required

Given a spec declaring `Deployment: backend-service`, a translator reads
this template to determine defaults, constraints, and valid overrides
before generating any code or packaging.

INPUTS:
```
template: TemplateTable
spec_meta: Map<string, string>
preset:    Map<string, string>
```

OUTPUTS:
```
resolved: Map<string, string>
warnings: List<string>
errors:   List<string>
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- template is the backend-service template (Template-For = "backend-service")
- spec_meta contains at least Deployment, Verification, Safety-Level

STEPS:
1. Verify Template-For = "backend-service"; on mismatch → error, halt.
2. Merge preset layers in order: vendor → system → user → project (last writer wins).
3. For each constraint=required key K: if not resolved → errors += violation.
4. For each constraint=default key K: apply preset value if present, else template default.
5. For each constraint=forbidden key K: if present in spec_meta or any preset → errors += violation.
6. For each constraint=supported key K: apply if declared in spec_meta or preset; skip silently if absent.
7. Apply LANGUAGE precedence: project preset > user preset > system preset > template default.
8. Validate cross-key constraints (e.g. BINARY-TYPE vs LANGUAGE, PLATFORM vs OUTPUT-FORMAT).
   On violation → errors += constraint description.
9. If errors non-empty → return errors (reject, do not return resolved).
   Else → return resolved.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- resolved contains an effective value for every required key
- resolved["LANGUAGE"] follows precedence:
    project preset > user preset > system preset > template default

---

## BEHAVIOR/INTERNAL: precedence-resolution
Constraint: required

Defines how conflicting values across layers are resolved for any key.

STEPS:
1. Start with template defaults as the base map.
2. Merge /usr/share/pcd/presets/ values (vendor defaults); later entries override earlier.
3. Merge /etc/pcd/presets/ values (system admin); overrides vendor defaults.
4. Merge ~/.config/pcd/presets/ values (user); overrides system.
5. Merge <project-dir>/.pcd/ values (project-local); overrides user.
6. For each key in spec META: if constraint=supported → apply; if constraint=required or default →
   emit Warning: "Spec overrides template default for <K>. Ensure this is intentional."
7. If spec META declares a constraint=forbidden key → emit Error: "Key <K> is forbidden in backend-service specs."
8. Return merged result.

## PRECONDITIONS

- This template is applied only when spec META declares Deployment: backend-service
- Preset files must be valid TOML
- LANGUAGE value in resolved output must be one of: Go, Rust, C, C++, C#
- If LANGUAGE is C#, PLATFORM must include Windows
- If BINARY-TYPE is dynamic, LANGUAGE must be one of: C, C++, C#
- If LANGUAGE is Go or Rust, BINARY-TYPE must be static

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- Every spec using Deployment: backend-service is governed by this template
- A spec may not declare LANGUAGE directly in META unless using Deployment: manual
- Resolved LANGUAGE is always one of the LANGUAGE-ALTERNATIVES or the default
- curl is never an accepted install method, regardless of preset override
- Forbidden constraints cannot be overridden by any preset or spec declaration

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]  constraint=forbidden rows cannot be overridden at any preset layer
- [observable]  constraint=required rows must resolve to a value; missing value is an error
- [observable]  LANGUAGE resolution always produces exactly one value
- [observable]  OUTPUT-FORMAT required rows must appear in every build configuration
- [observable]  a spec declaring Deployment: backend-service inherits all required constraints
- [observable]  BINARY-TYPE=dynamic is only valid when LANGUAGE ∈ {C, C++, C#}
- [observable]  BINARY-TYPE=static is the only valid value when LANGUAGE ∈ {Go, Rust}
- [observable]  services log to stdout/stderr rather than private log files

## DELIVERABLES

Defines the files a translator must produce for each OUTPUT-FORMAT
declared as `required` or active `supported`.

### Delivery Order

1. Core implementation files
2. Service and packaging artifacts
3. Supported packaging artifacts if preset active
4. Test infrastructure
5. Documentation
6. TRANSLATION_REPORT.md last, after all other files are written and verified

### Deliverables Table

| OUTPUT-FORMAT | Constraint | Required Deliverable Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| source | required | `main.go` or `cmd/<n>/main.go`, `go.mod` | Single binary service. Split files only when complexity requires it. |
| build | required | `Makefile` | Must include `build`, `test`, `install`, `clean` targets. |
| service | required | `<n>.service` | systemd unit for Linux service deployment. |
| docs | required | `README.md` | Must document installation, config file path, arguments, endpoints, and signal handling. |
| license | required | `LICENSE` | Follow the translator prompt and spec license instructions. |
| RPM | required | `<n>.spec` | OBS RPM spec file. Must install the binary, service unit, and default config path if spec declares one. |
| DEB | required | `debian/control`, `debian/changelog`, `debian/rules`, `debian/copyright` | Debian package metadata. Must install the service unit. |
| OCI | supported | `Containerfile` | Multi-stage build. Final stage must be `FROM scratch` or distroless. Expose only ports declared in the spec DEPLOYMENT section. |
| binary | supported | none | Raw binary only. |
| report | required | `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` | Must include service startup/shutdown notes, config-loading notes, and compile gate result. |

### Systemd Service Unit

For Linux/systemd deployment, install a service unit in the package:

```ini
[Unit]
Description={component name}
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/{n} config=/etc/{n}/config.json
Restart=on-failure
NoNewPrivileges=true
User={n}
Group={n}

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Adjust `ExecStart` and config path only if the spec DEPLOYMENT section declares
different values. Do not add environment-variable based configuration.

---

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: long-running service process, typically supervised by systemd.

Naming convention:
  Binary name: {n}
  Service unit: {n}.service
  Default config directory: /etc/{n}/

Packaging:
  RPM and DEB are mandatory.
  OCI is optional and produced only when active in preset.

---

## EXECUTION

The translator must read this section before generating any code.
It specifies the exact delivery phases, resume logic, and compile gate
for backend-service components. Follow it exactly.

### Input files

The translator receives in the working directory:
- `backend-service.template.md` — this deployment template
- `<spec-name>.md` — the component specification

If the spec's DEPENDENCIES section references hints files, they are also
present. Read them before writing `go.mod` or any code that uses those
libraries.

### Resume logic

Before writing any file, list the output directory.
If a listed deliverable already exists and is non-empty, skip it — treat
it as complete and move to the next missing file. Report which files were
found and which are being produced.

### Delivery phases

Produce files in this exact order. Complete each phase before starting
the next. Do not produce `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` until Phase 5 is done.

**Phase 1 — Core implementation**
- All source files
- `go.mod`

**Phase 2 — Service and packaging**
- `Makefile`
- `<n>.service`
- `<n>.spec`
- `debian/control`, `debian/changelog`, `debian/rules`, `debian/copyright`
- `Containerfile` (if OCI is active in preset)
- `LICENSE`

**Phase 3 — Test infrastructure**
- `independent_tests/INDEPENDENT_TESTS.go`
- `translation_report/translation-workflow.pikchr`

**Phase 4 — Documentation**
- `README.md`

**Phase 5 — Compile gate**

**Phase 6 — Report (last)**
- `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md`

### Compile gate

Execute after Phase 4 and before Phase 6. If your environment cannot
execute shell commands, document this explicitly in `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md`.

**Step 1 — Dependency resolution**

Run: `go mod tidy`

If `go mod tidy` cannot be run:
- Produce `go.mod` with direct dependencies only, no `go.sum`
- Note in `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` that `go mod tidy` must be run before building

**Step 2 — Compilation**

Run: `go build ./...`

If compilation fails, fix only the identified errors and re-run.

**Step 3 — Record result**

Record pass/fail for each step in `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md`.
Once all steps pass, do not modify any source files further.
