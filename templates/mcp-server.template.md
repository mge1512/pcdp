## TYPES

```
Language := Go | Python | Rust
// Go is the default. Python and Rust are supported alternatives.
// No other languages permitted for MCP servers in v1.

GoFramework := mcp-go | go-sdk
// mcp-go:  github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go
//          Community SDK. Supports stdio, Streamable HTTP, SSE, in-process.
//          Default choice: covers all required transports.
// go-sdk:  github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk
//          Official SDK, maintained with Google. Supports stdio and command
//          transports. HTTP transport support in progress.
//          Choose when: spec compliance priority or official SDK required.
// The framework is selected via preset; not declared in the spec itself.

Transport := stdio | streamable-http
// Both transports are required for all mcp-server components.
// stdio:           Used by mcphost, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and similar
//                  CLI-based MCP hosts. The server reads from stdin and
//                  writes to stdout. Launched as a subprocess by the host.
// streamable-http: Used by web-based MCP hosts, remote access, and
//                  multi-client scenarios. HTTP POST for requests,
//                  Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses.
//                  Endpoint: /mcp (default), configurable via listen=

MCPCapability := tools | resources | prompts | sampling
// tools:     Functions the LLM can call. Primary capability for most servers.
// resources: Read-only data sources the LLM can access (files, DB records).
// prompts:   Reusable prompt templates the LLM can request.
// sampling:  Server-initiated LLM sampling (advanced, rarely needed).

ToolName := string where matches "^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$"
// Snake_case or hyphen-separated. No spaces. No uppercase.
// Must be unique within the server.

ErrorCode := integer
// MCP error codes follow JSON-RPC 2.0 conventions:
// -32700: Parse error
// -32600: Invalid request
// -32601: Method not found
// -32602: Invalid params
// -32603: Internal error
// Application-specific errors: -32000 to -32099

ListenAddress := string
// Default: 127.0.0.1:8080 for streamable-http transport
// Override via listen= key=value argument
```

## DELIVERABLES

Defines the files a translator must produce. All required OUTPUT-FORMATs
must be produced. Supported OUTPUT-FORMATs are produced if active in preset.

### Delivery Order

1. Core implementation files
2. Required packaging artifacts (RPM, DEB, OCI)
3. Supported artifacts if preset active
4. TRANSLATION_REPORT.md last, after all files verified and compiled

### Deliverables Table

| OUTPUT-FORMAT | Constraint | Required Deliverable Files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| source | required | `main.go`, `go.mod` | Single file preferred under ~800 lines. Tool handlers may be split into `tools.go`, `resources.go` etc. for larger servers. |
| build | required | `Makefile` | Targets: `build`, `test`, `install`, `clean`. CGO_ENABLED=0. |

| report | required | `TRANSLATION_REPORT.md` | Must include: framework choice rationale, transport implementation notes, tool list with descriptions, compilation result. |

### Systemd Service Unit

For http transport mode, a systemd service unit is required in both RPM
and DEB packaging:

```ini
[Unit]
Description={component name} MCP server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mcp-server-{n} http listen=127.0.0.1:8080
Restart=on-failure
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Deliverable Content Requirements

**main.go must implement both transports:**
```go
// Invocation:
//   mcp-server-{n} stdio          ← serve over stdin/stdout
//   mcp-server-{n} http           ← serve over HTTP (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)
//   mcp-server-{n} http listen=host:port
func main() {
    // Parse transport from first argument (bare word: stdio | http)
    // Parse key=value options
    // Initialise server with capabilities declared in spec
    // Run selected transport
}
```

**go.mod framework selection:**

For mcp-go (default):
```
require github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go vX.Y.Z
```

For go-sdk (alternative):
```
require github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk vX.Y.Z
```

**Containerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24 AS builder
WORKDIR /build
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o mcp-server-{n} .

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /build/mcp-server-{n} /usr/bin/mcp-server-{n}
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/mcp-server-{n}", "http"]
```

## BEHAVIOR: stdio-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
```
(reads JSON-RPC 2.0 messages from stdin)
```

OUTPUTS:
```
(writes JSON-RPC 2.0 messages to stdout)
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- stdin is connected to an MCP-compatible host
- Server capabilities are declared in spec BEHAVIOR sections

STEPS:
1. Register all tools declared in spec BEHAVIOR sections.
2. Enter read loop: read one JSON-RPC 2.0 message from stdin.
3. On parse error → write JSON-RPC error response to stdout; continue loop.
4. Dispatch message to registered handler.
   MECHANISM: handle each request in its own goroutine so slow handlers
   do not block stdin reads.
5. Write JSON-RPC response to stdout (synchronise writes; no interleaving).
6. On EOF from stdin → drain in-flight goroutines, exit 0.
7. On SIGTERM/SIGINT → drain in-flight goroutines, exit 0.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- Server responds to all MCP protocol messages
- Errors are returned as JSON-RPC error responses, never as panics
- On EOF from stdin: clean shutdown, exit 0
- On SIGTERM/SIGINT: drain in-flight requests, exit 0

---

## BEHAVIOR: http-transport
Constraint: required

INPUTS:
```
listen: string   // host:port to bind; default 127.0.0.1:8080
```

OUTPUTS:
```
(serves HTTP POST /mcp for requests)
(serves GET /mcp with SSE for streaming)
```

PRECONDITIONS:
- listen address is available and bindable
- Server capabilities declared in spec BEHAVIOR sections

STEPS:
1. Register all tools declared in spec BEHAVIOR sections.
2. Bind HTTP listener on listen address; on bind error → exit 1 with diagnostic.
3. Register POST /mcp handler (JSON-RPC 2.0 request/response).
4. Register GET /mcp handler (Server-Sent Events for streaming responses).
5. Accept connections.
   On POST /mcp: parse JSON-RPC body; on parse error → HTTP 400 + JSON-RPC error body.
   Dispatch to handler; return HTTP 200 + JSON-RPC response body (errors included in body per spec).
   On GET /mcp: upgrade to SSE; stream responses until handler completes or client disconnects.
6. On SIGTERM/SIGINT → stop accepting new connections, drain in-flight requests,
   close listener, exit 0.
   MECHANISM: use context cancellation propagated from signal handler.

POSTCONDITIONS:
- Server accepts connections on listen address
- POST /mcp handles JSON-RPC 2.0 requests
- GET /mcp streams Server-Sent Events for streaming responses
- On SIGTERM/SIGINT: drain in-flight requests, close listener, exit 0
- Errors returned as HTTP 4xx/5xx with JSON-RPC error body

---

## PRECONDITIONS

- Both stdio and streamable-http transports must be implemented
- At least one MCP tool must be declared in the spec BEHAVIOR sections
- All tool names must match ToolName type (lowercase, no spaces)
- External service dependencies must be declared in DEPLOYMENT section
- Server must not read configuration from environment variables

---

## POSTCONDITIONS

- Binary serves both transports from the same binary
- Transport selected by bare word argument (stdio | http)
- All tools declared in spec BEHAVIOR sections are registered and callable
- All errors are JSON-RPC 2.0 error responses
- Server handles concurrent tool calls safely (Go goroutines)
- Systemd service units are included in RPM and DEB packaging

---

## INVARIANTS

- [observable]      both transports always implemented — never one without the other
- [observable]      tool names are lowercase and match ^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$
- [observable]      all errors are JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted — no panics reach the client
- [implementation]  CGO_ENABLED=0 for Go — static binary, no libc dependency
- [observable]      configuration via key=value only — no environment variables
- [observable]      TRANSLATION_REPORT.md documents the Go framework choice
- [observable]      template version recorded in every audit bundle

## EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE: minimal_tool_server_stdio
GIVEN:
  spec declares one BEHAVIOR: tool named "greet"
  invocation: mcp-server-{n} stdio
  MCP host sends: {"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "greet", "arguments": {"name": "World"}}}
WHEN:
  server processes the tool call
THEN:
  server responds with JSON-RPC result containing greeting text
  response written to stdout
  exit_code = 0 on EOF

EXAMPLE: minimal_tool_server_http
GIVEN:
  spec declares one BEHAVIOR: tool named "greet"
  invocation: mcp-server-{n} http listen=127.0.0.1:9000
WHEN:
  MCP host sends POST /mcp with tool call JSON-RPC body
THEN:
  server returns 200 with JSON-RPC result body
  server remains running, accepts further requests

EXAMPLE: unknown_transport_argument
GIVEN:
  invocation: mcp-server-{n} websocket
WHEN:
  server starts
THEN:
  stderr = "error: unknown transport 'websocket'. Valid: stdio, http"
  exit_code = 2

EXAMPLE: tool_error_handling
GIVEN:
  invocation: mcp-server-{n} stdio
  MCP host calls a tool that encounters an internal error
WHEN:
  tool handler returns an error
THEN:
  server returns JSON-RPC error response (not a panic)
  stderr contains error log entry with timestamp
  server continues running and accepts further requests

EXAMPLE: graceful_shutdown_http
GIVEN:
  server running in http mode with active connection
  SIGTERM signal received
WHEN:
  signal handler fires
THEN:
  server stops accepting new connections
  in-flight requests complete (up to 30 second drain timeout)
  server exits 0

EXAMPLE: framework_mcp_go_default
GIVEN:
  no preset override for GO-FRAMEWORK
  translator reads TEMPLATE-TABLE
WHEN:
  translator selects Go framework
THEN:
  go.mod contains: require github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go
  TRANSLATION_REPORT.md documents: "GO-FRAMEWORK: mcp-go (template default)"
  both stdio and http transports implemented using mcp-go API

EXAMPLE: framework_go_sdk_override

## DEPLOYMENT

Runtime: long-running server process, single static binary

Invocation:
  mcp-server-{n} stdio
  mcp-server-{n} http
  mcp-server-{n} http listen=host:port

Transport selection (bare word, first argument):
  stdio    stdin/stdout JSON-RPC 2.0
  http     Streamable HTTP on listen address

Key=value options:
  listen=host:port    HTTP listen address (default: 127.0.0.1:8080)

Output streams:
  stdout: JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol messages (stdio transport)
          or unused (http transport — do not mix with protocol messages)
  stderr: Server logs, errors, startup messages

Naming convention:
  Binary name: mcp-server-{n}
  where {n} is the use-case identifier, lowercase, hyphen-separated
  Examples: mcp-server-pcdp, mcp-server-github, mcp-server-postgres

Installation:
  OBS package: mcp-server-{n}
  Available for: openSUSE Leap, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu
  No curl-based installation.
  Systemd service for http mode included in package.

Platform:
  Linux (primary, both transports)
  macOS (supported, both transports)
  Windows (supported, stdio transport only in v1)

Go Framework Selection Guide:
  mcp-go (default):  Quick setup, both transports, active community,
                     slightly more opinionated API
  go-sdk (alt):      Official spec compliance, Google collaboration,
                     stdio well-supported; check HTTP transport status
                     before selecting for production http use
